#Stuffed Animal Violence

This is a game we wrote in Swift using SpriteKit.  It introduced multi-peer connectivity across iPhone/iPad.

This is (supposed to be) a Smash Bros.- style fighting game, where players can join and leave on the fly.  Your iPhone works as your game controller and displays your health and energy as well.  The game displays on the iPad.  You play as stuffed animals.  Violence ensueth.
